# HopHacks2017
My first Hackathon experience...
------
I played around with methods to train and model convolutional neural networks, 
with an application to the Fashion MNIST set, and an application to the Kaggle 
cdiscounts-image-classification-challenge.

-----

Welp, I went to sleep a few hours after the tensorflow workshop, coded for ~25 hours, tried to take a 2 hour nap before
presentations, and woke up after presentations were over.

I started with a copy-pasted python script of a simple neural net to solve the Digit Recognizer MNIST data set,
having never written a program in python before, and this is where I ended.

I learned that Neural Nets are a bad thing for hackathons - YOU HAVE TO TRAIN THEM (Lol).
But, I learned a lot through experimenting with ways to train - my notes files are interesting.

Also - my partners ditched me quite early on and only assisted by writing a broken data parsing script,
but what can you do. Much was learned, much more to learn, but first I should probably do my homework...
